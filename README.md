# Installation
Make sure you have already installed library sklearn, seaborn and tqdm. Except for these, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, given the Starbucks offer, customer profile, customer transaction data, I am going to:
1. Combine transaction, demographic and offer data to analyze which demographic groups respond(i.e.view&complete) best to which offer type;
2. Build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer.
